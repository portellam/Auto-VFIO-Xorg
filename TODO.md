### To Do:
* Usage
    - Fix
    - Extend
    - Execute or skip setups?
    - Update for every relevant question.
* Trim fat, remove unnecessary repetitions and code.
* Pre-setup:
    - Evdev, save output to logfile, for use in VM XML.
* VFIO setup:
    - Detect existing setup, and recommend update or uninstall to continue.
    - VFIO output, read/write from/to XML file for easier updating.
* Post-setup:
    - Auto-Xorg, add question for params (outside usage).
    - Create script or program to resume VM(s) from sleep?
* Errors/exceptions, handle and/or save to logfile (subjectively, important for user-operation, not development).
* Ask question to do each function, then execute after asking all questions (pre and post-setup).
* Include example XML files for virtual machines?
* Include visual guides?
* Make script distro-agnostic?
