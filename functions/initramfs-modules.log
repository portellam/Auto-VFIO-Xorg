# List of modules that you want to include in your initramfs.
# They will be loaded at boot time in the order below.
#
# Syntax:  module_name [args ...]
#
# You must run update-initramfs(8) to effect this change.
#
# Examples:
#
# raid1
# sd_mod
#
# NOTE: GRUB command line is an easier and cleaner method if vfio-pci grabs all hardware.
# Example: Reboot hypervisor (Linux) to swap host graphics (Intel, AMD, NVIDIA) by use-case (AMD for Win XP, NVIDIA for Win 10).
# NOTE: If you change this file, run 'update-initramfs -u -k all' afterwards to update.
# NOTE: In terminal, execute "lspci -nnk" or review the logfiles.

# Soft dependencies and PCI kernel drivers:	(NOTE: repeat for each driver)
# EXAMPLE:
#	softdep 'DRIVER_NAME' pre: vfio-pci
#	'DRIVER_NAME'

#

# NOTE: Do not change the following lines, unless you know what you are doing!
vfio
vfio_iommu_type1
vfio_virqfd
#

# GRUB command line and PCI hardware IDs:
options vfio_pci ids=
vfio_pci ids=
vfio_pci
