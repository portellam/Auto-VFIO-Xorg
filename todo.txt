MultiBoot
-at kernel update, parse system file and change kernel string to latest/current
-create a generated file for grub boot proxies, and create shebang for it
-leave 'custom' file for system

VFIO setup
-ignore snd_hda_intel driver, as it is necessary for most/all audio devices 

-libvirt hooks
	-create hook to dynamically set cpu isolation
	-or ask user to set isolation manually in GRUB
	-for this task, find best cpu pin layout
	-for this task, run before vfio-setup and append to GRUB logfile for output (like hugepages)

-audio reverse passthrough (speaker no mic), Scream or Jack+PulseWire (?)
-Looking Glass

-setup Auto-Xorg, perhaps update

issue:      virt-manager GUI does not support wakeup suspended domains (sleeping VMs)
solution:   system service that will detect asleep VMs, and activate them only after host wakeup
another:    create GUI app that pops up around 2 sec after host wake and user relogin

-install-functions/
    -set cpu pins static or dynamically
