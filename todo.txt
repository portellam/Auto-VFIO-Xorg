files dir
-templates
-output files

backups dir
-backup system files here
-or in same dir as original

uninstallers
-restore backups if available
-otherwise copy templates over

libvirt hooks
-create hook to dynamically set cpu isolation
-or ask user to set isolation manually in GRUB
-for this task, find best cpu pin layout
-for this task, run before vfio-setup and append to GRUB logfile for output (like hugepages)

redo filenames
preserve numerical orders for functions
reduce redundancies

review ArchWiki
    -there likely exists parsing functions that achieve what I do, but better and with more low-level commands (nice)
    -ex: parse sort and list pci dev's by IOMMU group

review r/VFIO
    -tips tricks and other user improvements

auto VM deployment
-reference cpu isolation/optimal cpu pin layout

audio reverse passthrough (speaker no mic), Scream or Jack+PulseWire (?)
Looking Glass

setup Auto-Xorg, perhaps update

issue:      virt-manager GUI does not support wakeup suspended domains (sleeping VMs)
solution:   system service that will detect asleep VMs, and activate them only after host wakeup
another:    create GUI app that pops up around 2 sec after host wake and user relogin

vfio setup multi-boot
-find system files and output to them!

    -set cpu pins static or dynamically
