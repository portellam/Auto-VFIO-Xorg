* when user selects IOMMU groups, stop and warn user when user selects all groups with VGA.
    -explain that if user continues, no VGA devices will remain for the host to use.
    -this will create a headless system, which the user may not want.
    -this is only an issue for static vfio setups, not multiboot.
    -to automate this process, set a flag that bypasses the VFIO setup prompt, and install Multiboot setup.

* when user asks to update conf files for a service, stop and warn user if the service has active processes.
    -example: zram-swap, if a zram-swap device is active AND is has data, stop.
    -example: libvirtd, if a user is updating evdev, and a VM is running, stop.

* make it so that this script may be automated:
    -in its entireity, use opts/args. Figure out how the binaries/source files will come into play.
    -at minimum, the VFIO setup.

* for automatic recall and redelpoyment, save important vars to logfile:
    -size of hugepages
    -amount of hugepages
    -IOMMU groups, and the devices' infos
    -etc.

* add new opts/args
    -specify user for libvirtd, otherwise check for first valid user

* Rename variables
    -Naming convention, start with underscore, then uppercase, separate words with delimiter (underscore).
    -Do not use datatype prefixes anymore.
    -Prefix with underscore, to avoid overwriting same name environment variables.

* Save libraries and bash script to "/usr/local/bin".

* Create a script that watches for kernel change, and recommends reinstall of vfio setup?

23/04/04

* Reduce dependency on bashlib functions
    -may need to keep functions that check distro and package manager.
    - Replace unused function calls with bash equivalents.
