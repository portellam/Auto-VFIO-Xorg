# /etc/modules: kernel modules to load at boot time.
#
# This file contains the names of kernel modules that should be loaded
# at boot time, one per line. Lines beginning with "#" are ignored.
#
# NOTE: GRUB command line is an easier and cleaner method if vfio-pci grabs all hardware.
# Example: Reboot hypervisor (Linux) to swap host graphics (Intel, AMD, NVIDIA) by use-case (AMD for Win XP, NVIDIA for Win 10).
# NOTE: If you change this file, run 'update-initramfs -u -k all' afterwards to update.
# NOTE: In terminal, execute "lspci -nnk" or review the logfiles.
#

# NOTE: Do not change the following lines, unless you know what you are doing!
vfio
vfio_iommu_type1
vfio_pci
vfio_virqfd
kvm
kvm_intel
apm power_off=1

# GRUB kernel parameters:
